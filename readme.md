This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for thermal springs observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Thermal Spring URI for a particular spring is the cross-referencing link (foreign key) used to associate the spring record, temperature measurements, chemistry and other information from a particular spring. Each entry is for one spring. Multiple observations (such as: temperature observations, chemical analyses) from the same spring would be entered on separate, appropriate spreadsheets/templates. If these separate observations exist, there should be a link to them entered on the Thermal Spring template, entered under Related Resources.

Deployed services use the approved 1.6 version. A new version 1.8 has beeen approved by GDSDPWG, but has not been used for services yet. Some versioning of new services or a meshing of the 1.6 and 1.8 needs to be determined.  2013-03-07
